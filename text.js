var clericText = "HEALERS AND WARRIORS<br>Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, lIowing from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don't grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fuIfi11a high calling. Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity's wishes. Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down liames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.<br><br>DEVINE AGENTS<br>Not every acolyte or officiant at a tem pIe or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods' will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at alI. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies. When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities' worshipers, which ean mean fighting rampaging ores, negotiating peaee between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prinee to enter the world. Most adventuring clerics maintain some eonneetion to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a clerie's aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.<br><br>Do you wish to continue as this class?";

Many druids pursue a myslic spiriluality of lranscendent union with nature ralher than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animais, or elemental forces. The ancienl druidic lraditions are sometimes called the Old Failh, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines. Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals--the power of toolh and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.<br><br>PRESERVE THE BALANCE<br>For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world-air, earth, fire,and water-must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the eJemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others. Druids are also concerncd with the deJicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animallife, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind f1ayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, espccially when the monsters encroach on the druids' territory. Druids arc often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature.

var mwText = "CUNNING WARIORS<br><br>To be counted among those who can walk the mists is no easy feat and as such, Mist Walkers are incredibly dedicated warriors. Focusing their mind to absorb the entirety of their surroundings they track their enemies and engage them at blinding speeds— often from behind. The mental fortitude it takes to harness the power of the mists, while engaged in the throes of combat is significant. Mist walkers strike fast and hard against their most dangerous foes, and just as abruptly as they appear, they’re gone— already calculating their next attack. Speed and surprise are a Mist Walker’s greatest asset, which is probably why so many favor a pair of shorter blades— though some Mist Walkers still prefer to fight with shield, knowing that they so often find themselves behind enemy lines. Still some prefer to further engage their enemies from a distance, mixing their skill with a bow with the ability to manipulate the mists to cripple their foes and aid their allies.<br><br>BATLEFIELD STRIKERS<br>Due to the nature of their abilities and intellectual aptitude, Mist Walkers excel at two professions in particular: that of the soldier, and assassin.

var paladinText = "THE CAUSE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS<br>A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin's power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.  Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice.<br><br>BEOND THE MUNDANE LIFE<br>Almost by definition, the !ife of a paladin is an adventuring !ife.

When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.  Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven bya higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure.

They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily thraugh the wilds and hiding lhemselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes. Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature's power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting lhe borderlands.<br><br>INDEPENDENT ADVENTURERS<br>Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger's true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization fram lhe ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes lhat press in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be lhe first-and possibly the last-line of defense. This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far fram the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.";

var sorcererText = "RAW MAGIC<br>Magic is a part of every sorcerer. suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways. The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby's birth, or ataste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So toa might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the [nner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality. Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on. nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.<br>\UNEXPLAINED POWERS<br>Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it's unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn't like tostay quiet. A sorcerer's magic wants to be wielded. and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn't called on.  Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origino Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential.

The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock's being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells, Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.<br><br>DELVERS INTO SECRETS<br>Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives, This thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as well. Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known, Sut many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore. a brilliant but crazed student's mind is opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings lhat dwell in the outer void. Once a pact is made, a warlock's thirst for knowledge and power can't be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty palron if he or she doesn't intend to use the power thus gained.
